# MksBoids

---

## TODO:
- get desired behaviour working
- sliders for cohere, align, separate
- slider for speed and energy
- checkbox to enable/disable max speed setting in each of the three forces. This is for me to see what happens when I allow/disallow them because I'm not sure why theyre there but I know it doesn't work properly without them.
- remember to group sliders based on energy and force. eg energy and speed vs separation, alignment, cohesion
- do NOT make an advanced UI
- Add trace element/checkbox (for the first boid. maybe all of them for fun)
- Add download SS element
- consider sliders for perception radius for each force, and a checkbox to link them all
- slider for boid count

---

## Ways in which I can expand boids
- implement perception, so boids can only see in front of them within a range
- add triangles
- make the edges obstacles, not wrap around
- alternatively allow sight on the ohter side of the edge
- add a predator boid thats bigger, and moves different (faster/slower) to the smaller boid
